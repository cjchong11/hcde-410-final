# HCDE FINAL PROJECT

This project is meant to explore the changes in particulate in Seoul, South Korea and how this potentially has an effect on asthma cases. I hope to display these changes in levels of pollution through visualizations to illustrate the growing importance of mitigating further environmental pollution as they may pose a risk to public health.
